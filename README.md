# Dog Breed Guesser Game

This game was initially completed for the [JavaScript: From First Steps to Professional](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-first-steps/) course. The initial file provided can be found [here](https://anjana.dev/javascript-first-steps/3-doggofetch-starter.html).
The start screen, next and reset buttons, and score keeping functionality were added by me in addition to material covered by the course.
